Q1. Introduction to HTML and its structure.
Ans:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the basic structure of a webpage, allowing developers to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML works together with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

Basic Structure of an HTML Document: 
An HTML document consists of various elements enclosed within tags (<tag>...</tag>). The fundamental structure includes:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
<p>This is a basic HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>

Q2. Explanation of key tags:
Ans:
o <a>: Anchor tag for hyperlinks.
--> The <a> tag is used to create hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between pages or external websites.
Syntax: 
<a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
- href attribute specifies the URL.
- _blank in target="_blank" opens the link in a new tab.

o <form>: Form tag for user input.
--> The <form> tag is used to collect user input, such as text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit buttons.
Syntax:
<form action="submit.php" method="post">
<label for="name">Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name">
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
- action defines where to send form data.
- method can be GET or POST

o <table>: Table tag for data representation.
--> The <table> tag is used to display data in a tabular format.
Syntax:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Age</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alice</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
</table>
- <tr> represents a row.
- <th> defines a table header.
- <td> represents a table cell.

o <img>: Image tag for embedding images.
--> The <img> tag is used to insert images into a webpage.
Syntax:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" width="300" height="200">
- src specifies the image path.
- alt provides alternative text.
- width and height define dimensions.

o List tags: <ul>, <ol>, and <li>.
--> Lists help in organizing content in a structured way.
- Unordered List (<ul>) – Displays items with bullets.
- Ordered List (<ol>) – Displays items with numbers.
- List Item (<li>) – Represents an item inside a list.
Syntax:
<ul>
<li>Apple</li>
<li>Banana</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>First Step</li>
<li>Second Step</li>
</ol>

o <p>: Paragraph tag.
--> The <p> tag is used to structure text into separate paragraphs.
Syntax:
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

o <br>: Line break.
--> The <br> tag inserts a line break without starting a new paragraph.
Syntax:
<p>First line.<br>Second line.</p>

o <label>: Label for form inputs.
--> The <label> tag associates a text description with a form input.
Syntax:
<label for="email">Email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email">
- for attribute links the label to the corresponding input field.

    CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS, External CSS

Q3. Overview of CSS and its importance in web design.
Ans:
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows developers to style web pages by changing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements.

CSS Importance in Web Design:
- Enhances Visual Appeal – CSS makes web pages visually attractive with colors, typography, and layouts.
- Ensures Consistency – A single CSS file can style multiple pages, maintaining a uniform look.
- Improves User Experience – Well-structured layouts and responsive designs create a better browsing experience.
- Reduces Code Repetition – CSS separates design from HTML, making code cleaner and easier to maintain.
- Enables Responsive Design – CSS helps web pages adapt to different screen sizes using media queries.
- Faster Page Load Speed – External CSS files reduce HTML file size, improving website performance.

Q4. Types of CSS:
Ans: 
o Inline CSS: Directly in HTML elements.
--> Inline CSS is applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.
🔹 Usage: When styling a single element without affecting others.
🔹 Disadvantage: Difficult to manage for larger projects due to code repetition.
Example: <p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This is an inline styled paragraph.</p>

o Internal CSS: Inside a <style> tag in the head section.
--> Internal CSS is written inside the <style> tag within the <head> section of an HTML document.
🔹 Usage: When styling a single page without an external stylesheet.
🔹 Disadvantage: Not reusable across multiple pages.
Example: <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p {
color: green;
font-size: 20px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an internally styled paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

o External CSS: Linked to an external file.
--> External CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.
🔹 Usage: When applying styles across multiple web pages for consistency.
🔹 Advantage: Improves code maintainability and makes HTML cleaner.
Example:
🔹 CSS File (styles.css)
p {
color: red;
font-size: 22px;
}
🔹 HTML File
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an externally styled paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

            CSS: Margin and Padding

Q5. Definition and difference between margin and padding.
Ans:
Feature	            Margin	                            Padding
Position	        Outside the element	                Inside the element
Effect on Size	    Does not increase element size	    Increases element size
Purpose	            Creates space between elements	    Creates space within the element around the content
CSS Property	    margin	                            padding

Q6. How margins create space outside the element and padding creates space inside.
Ans:
How Margins Create Space Outside an Element
Margin adds space outside an element, pushing it away from other elements. It does not affect the element’s size but increases the gap between elements.

🔹 Example:
div {
width: 200px;
height: 100px;
background-color: lightblue;
margin: 20px;
}

(Margin 20px)
--------------------
|    DIV Element    |
--------------------
(Margin 20px)

-This creates 20px of empty space around the <div>, separating it from other elements.

How Padding Creates Space Inside an Element
Padding adds space inside an element, between its content and border. It increases the element’s overall size.
🔹 Example:
div {
width: 200px;
height: 100px;
background-color: lightblue;
padding: 20px;
}

----------------------
|    (Padding 20px)  |
|   Content Here     |
|    (Padding 20px)  |
----------------------

- This creates 20px of space inside the <div>, pushing the content away from its border.

                    CSS: Pseudo-Class

Q7. Introduction to CSS pseudo-classes like :hover, :focus, :active, etc.
Ans:
CSS pseudo-classes are special keywords that define a specific state of an element, allowing you to apply styles dynamically. They do not require extra HTML classes or IDs.

1. :hover (Mouse Over Effect)
- The :hover pseudo-class applies styles when a user moves the mouse pointer over an element.
🔹 Example: button:hover {
background-color: blue;
color: white;
}
Changes the button’s background color when hovered.

2. :focus (When an Element is Focused)
- The :focus pseudo-class applies styles when an input field or button is selected (clicked or navigated via keyboard).
🔹 Example: input:focus {
border: 2px solid green;
background-color: lightyellow;
}
Highlights an input field when the user clicks inside it.

3. :active (When an Element is Clicked)
- The :active pseudo-class applies styles when an element is being clicked (before release).
🔹 Example: a:active {
color: red;
}
The link turns red when clicked.

4. :first-child (Targets First Child Element)
- The :first-child pseudo-class selects the first child of a parent element.
🔹 Example: p:first-child {
font-weight: bold;
}
Makes the first <p> inside a container bold.

5. :last-child (Targets Last Child Element)
The :last-child pseudo-class selects the last child of a parent element.
🔹 Example:  p:last-child {
color: orange;
}
Changes the last <p> inside a container to orange.

6. :nth-child(n) (Targets Specific Child Elements)
- The :nth-child(n) pseudo-class selects elements based on their order inside a parent.
🔹 Example: li:nth-child(2) {
color: red;
}
Colors the second <li> item in a list red.

Q8. Use of pseudo-classes to style elements based on their state

        CSS: ID and Class Selectors

Q9. Difference between id and class in CSS.
Ans:
Feature	            id	                                class
Uniqueness	        Unique, used only once per page	    Can be applied to multiple elements
Selector Syntax	    #idname (e.g., #header)	            .classname (e.g., .button)
Reusability	        Not reusable	                    Reusable
Priority	        Higher specificity	                Lower specificity
JavaScript Use	    document.getElementById("idname")	document.getElementsByClassName("classname")

Q10. Usage scenarios for id (unique) and class (reusable)
Ans:
1. When to Use id (Unique Identifier)
✅ Use id when an element is unique and appears only once on a page.
✅ Suitable for specific elements that need distinct styling or JavaScript targeting.
🔹 Example Scenarios:
Navigation Bar (id="navbar") → There is only one navbar.
Main Header (id="main-title") → The main heading of a page.

🔹 Example Code:
<header id="main-title">Welcome to My Website</header>

#main-title {
font-size: 24px;
text-align: center;
}

2. When to Use class (Reusable Styles)
✅ Use class when the same style needs to be applied to multiple elements.
✅ Ideal for buttons, text styling, sections, and layout components.
🔹 Example Scenarios:
Button Styles (class="btn") → Used for all buttons.
Reusable Sections (class="section") → Multiple sections sharing the same styling.

🔹 Example Code:
<button class="btn">Click Me</button>
<button class="btn">Submit</button>

.btn {
background-color: blue;
color: white;
padding: 10px 20px;
border-radius: 5px;
}

        Introduction to Client-Server Architecture

Q11. Overview of client-server architecture.
Ans:    
Client-Server Architecture is a computing model where multiple clients (users or devices) communicate with a central server to request and receive services or data. It is widely used in networking, web applications, and distributed systems.

1. Components of Client-Server Architecture
1.1 Client
A client is a device or application that requests services from the server.
Examples: Web browsers, mobile apps, desktop applications.
Responsibilities:
Sends requests to the server.
Displays data received from the server.
Provides user interface and interaction.

1.2 Server
A server is a powerful computer or system that processes client requests and provides responses.
Examples: Web servers, database servers, file servers.
Responsibilities:
Processes client requests.
Stores and manages data.
Ensures security and authentication.

2. Working of Client-Server Architecture
- Client Initiates Request: The client sends a request to the server over a network (e.g., HTTP request in a web application).
- Server Processes Request: The server receives, processes the request, retrieves necessary data, and prepares a response.
- Server Sends Response: The server sends the requested data or service back to the client.
- Client Displays the Data: The client processes and displays the received data.

Q12. Difference between client-side and server-side processing.
Ans: 
Client-Side Processing:
- Definition: Processing that happens on the client’s device (browser, app, or computer).
- Where It Runs: Runs in the user's browser or device.
- Languages & Technologies:	HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Angular, Vue.js).
- Speed: Faster, as it doesn’t require constant communication with the server.
- Security:	Less secure since the code is visible to users and can be manipulated.
- Examples:	Form validation, animations, interactive UI, client-side storage (localStorage, sessionStorage).
- Use Cases: When immediate user interactions are needed without delays.

Server-Side Processing:
- Definition: Processing that happens on the server before sending data to the client.
- Where It Runs: Runs on the web server or backend system.
- Languages & Technologies:	PHP, Java, Python, C#, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, SQL.
- Speed: Slower, as it requires requests to be sent to the server and responses to be received.
- Security: More secure as processing happens on the server and code is hidden from users.
- Examples:	Authentication, database operations, business logic, file handling, data encryption.
- Use Cases: When security, data processing, and database interactions are required.

Q13. Roles of a client, server, and communication protocols.
Ans: 
1. Roles of a Client
A client is a device or application that requests services or data from a server.
Examples: Web browsers, mobile apps, desktop applications.

Responsibilities of a Client:
Sending Requests: Initiates communication by sending requests to the server (e.g., HTTP requests for web pages).
Processing Responses: Receives data from the server and displays it to the user.
User Interaction: Provides a graphical interface for user input and interaction.
Local Processing: Executes scripts (e.g., JavaScript for dynamic content) without contacting the server.
Caching Data: Stores temporary data to reduce load on the server and improve speed.

2. Roles of a Server
A server is a powerful computer or system that processes client requests and provides the requested resources.
Examples: Web servers, database servers, file servers.

Responsibilities of a Server:
Handling Requests: Receives and processes client requests.
Data Storage and Management: Stores databases, files, and other resources.
Security and Authentication: Ensures authorized access through authentication mechanisms.
Processing Business Logic: Runs backend scripts, applies business rules, and generates responses.
Load Balancing and Scalability: Distributes traffic efficiently across multiple servers.

3. Roles of Communication Protocols 
Communication protocols define the rules for data exchange between a client and a server.

Common Communication Protocols:
HTTP/HTTPS(Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure)): Transfers web data (HTML, CSS, JS) between browsers and web servers.
FTP	F(File Transfer Protocol): Transfers files between client and server.
TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol): Establishes reliable data transmission across networks.
DNS(Domain Name System): Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
SMTP/POP3/IMAP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol / Post Office Protocol / Internet Message Access Protocol): Manages email transmission and retrieval.
WebSockets: Enables real-time communication between client and server (e.g., chat applications).

            HTTP Protocol Overview with Request and Response Headers

Q14. Introduction to the HTTP Protocol and Its Role in Web Communication
Ans:
What is HTTP?
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of web communication. It is an application-layer protocol that enables the exchange of data between clients (such as web browsers) and servers over the internet. It is stateless, meaning each request is independent, and the server does not retain information from previous interactions.

Role of HTTP in Web Communication
HTTP plays a crucial role in how data is transmitted across the web. It allows web browsers to request web pages, retrieve resources (such as images, stylesheets, and scripts), and communicate with web servers. It operates using a request-response model, where:
- Client (e.g., browser) sends a request to a web server for a resource (like an HTML page).
- Server processes the request and sends back a response containing the requested data or an error message.

Q15. Explanation of HTTP request and response headers.
Ans:
What are HTTP Headers?
HTTP headers are key-value pairs included in both requests and responses. They provide additional information about the request or response, such as content type, caching policies, authentication, and more. Headers play a crucial role in web communication by ensuring proper data exchange between clients (browsers) and servers.

1. HTTP Request Headers
Request headers are sent by the client (browser, API, or application) to the server to provide information about the request and client environment.
Common HTTP Request Headers:

Header	            Description	                                                        Example
Host	            Specifies the target server domain.	                                Host: www.example.com
User-Agent	        Identifies the client making the request.	                        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept	            Specifies the media types the client can process.	                Accept: text/html, application/json
Authorization	    Provides authentication credentials (e.g., token, basic auth).	    Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type	    Specifies the data format sent in the request body (for POST/PUT).	Content-Type: application/json
Cookie	            Sends stored cookies to the server.	                                Cookie: sessionId=abcd1234
Referer	            Indicates the previous URL the user visited.	                    Referer: https://www.google.com
Accept-Encoding	    Specifies compression methods the client supports.	                Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection	        Controls the persistence of the connection.	                        Connection: keep-alive

2. HTTP Response Headers
Response headers are sent by the server to the client to provide information about the response, such as content type, caching policies, and security settings.

Common HTTP Response Headers:

Header	                            Description	                                            Example
Content-Type	                    Specifies the format of the response body.	         Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length	                    Defines the size of the response body (in bytes).	 Content-Length: 348
Cache-Control	                    Defines caching policies.	                         Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store,must-revalidate
ETag	                            Provides a unique identifier for caching validation. ETag: "abc123"
Set-Cookie	                        Sends cookies to the client.	                     Set-Cookie: sessionId=xyz123; HttpOnly
Server	                            Specifies server software details.	                 Server: Apache/2.4.41
Location	                        Redirects the client to a different URL.	         Location: https://example.com/login
Access-Control-Allow-Origin	        Controls cross-origin requests (CORS).	             Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)	Enforces HTTPS security.	                         Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000

                J2EE Architecture Overview

Q16. Introduction to J2EE and its multi-tier architecture.
Ans:
J2EE (now called Jakarta EE) is a platform-independent, Java-based environment used for developing, deploying, and running enterprise applications. It extends the capabilities of Java SE (Standard Edition) by providing APIs and tools for web applications, distributed computing, and enterprise-level solutions.

J2EE simplifies development by providing pre-built components for tasks like database access, transaction management, security, and messaging. It follows a multi-tier architecture that separates concerns and improves scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.

J2EE Multi-Tier Architecture:
J2EE applications follow a multi-tier architecture, which divides an application into logical layers for better scalability, modularity, and maintainability. It typically consists of four tiers:

1. Client Tier (Presentation Layer)
- The front-end where users interact with the application.
- Can be a web browser, mobile app, desktop application, or IoT device.
- Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSP (JavaServer Pages), or JSF (JavaServer Faces) for UI.
- Communicates with the Web Tier using HTTP.

2. Web Tier (Servlet/JSP Layer)
- Acts as a middle layer that processes user requests and generates responses.
- Contains Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), JSF (JavaServer Faces), and MVC frameworks like Spring MVC or Struts.
- Handles session management, request validation, and response formatting.
- Uses JSTL, AJAX, and REST APIs for dynamic web content.
- Can communicate with the Business Tier.

3. Business Tier (Application Logic Layer)
- Implements core business logic and rules.
- Uses Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs), Spring Boot, or Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).
- Handles transactions, security, concurrency, and business processing.
- Communicates with the Database (EIS) Tier via JDBC, JPA (Java Persistence API), or Hibernate.

4. Enterprise Information System (EIS) Tier (Data Layer)
- Manages data storage and retrieval.
- Uses relational databases (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra).
- Provides JDBC, JPA, Hibernate, and Java Transaction API (JTA) for database operations.
- Also includes messaging services (JMS), ERP, and legacy systems.

Q17. Role of web containers, application servers, and database servers
Ans:
Web Container :
A Web Container (also called a Servlet Container) is responsible for managing Java web components such as Servlets, JSPs (JavaServer Pages), and JSF (JavaServer Faces). It provides an environment for executing web applications that follow the Java EE specifications.
Responsibilities of a Web Container
✅ Handles HTTP Requests & Responses – Processes client requests (GET, POST, etc.) and sends responses.
✅ Manages Servlet Life Cycle – Loads, initializes, executes, and destroys Servlets.
✅ Supports JSP Execution – Compiles JSP pages into Servlets and executes them.
✅ Session Management – Maintains user sessions using cookies, URL rewriting, and HttpSession.
✅ Security – Provides authentication and authorization for web applications.
Examples : Apache Tomcat (Most commonly used for Servlets and JSP),Jetty,GlassFish (Web Tier),JBoss Web Container

Application Server :
An Application Server is responsible for running business logic in enterprise applications. It extends the capabilities of a Web Container by supporting Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs), transactions, security, messaging, and distributed computing.
Responsibilities of an Application Server
✅ Manages Business Logic – Processes business rules using EJBs or POJOs.
✅ Provides Transaction Management – Ensures ACID-compliant transactions with JTA (Java Transaction API).
✅ Handles Messaging – Supports JMS (Java Message Service) for asynchronous communication.
✅ Security & Authentication – Manages authentication, authorization, and encryption.
✅ Load Balancing & Scalability – Distributes requests across multiple servers for better performance.
Examples : GlassFish (Jakarta EE reference implementation), JBoss/WildFly, IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic, Apache TomEE

Database Server:
A Database Server stores and manages application data, ensuring efficient retrieval, storage, and processing of information.
Responsibilities of a Database Server
✅ Stores & Retrieves Data – Manages structured data for the application.
✅ Provides SQL Query Processing – Executes SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations.
✅ Ensures Data Integrity – Uses constraints, indexing, and foreign keys.
✅ Supports Transactions – Manages commit, rollback, and concurrency control.
✅ Handles Connection Pooling – Optimizes multiple database connections for performance.
Examples : MySQL , PostgreSQL,Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server ,MongoDB (NoSQL)

Q18. Introduction to CGI (Common Gateway Interface).
Ans:
What is CGI?
CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is a standard protocol used to enable communication between web servers and external applications (scripts or programs) to generate dynamic web content. It allows web pages to interact with databases, perform calculations, or handle user input dynamically.

How CGI Works?
- A user submits a form or requests a page (e.g., clicking a link).
- The web server detects a CGI request (a URL mapped to a CGI script).
- The server executes the CGI script (written in C, Perl, Python, Shell Script, etc.).
- The CGI script processes the request, interacts with databases (if needed), and generates HTML output.
- The server sends the output to the client (browser).

Q19. Process, advantages, and disadvantages of CGI programming
Ans:
Step-by-Step CGI Process:
- Client Request: A user requests a web page or submits a form (via HTTP).
- Web Server Identifies CGI Request: The request is mapped to a CGI script (e.g., Python, Perl, C, or Shell script).
- Server Executes CGI Script: The web server starts a separate process to execute the CGI script.
- Script Processes Data: It may interact with a database, perform calculations, or handle user input.
- Script Generates Output: The script outputs HTML, JSON, or other content with a proper HTTP header.
- Web Server Sends Response: The generated output is sent back to the browser for display.
Advantages of CGI Programming
Language Independence – Can be written in Python, Perl, C, PHP, Shell script, etc.
Simple & Easy to Implement – No need for advanced frameworks.
Supports Dynamic Content – Can process form data, database queries, and user input.
Compatible with Most Servers – Works with Apache, Nginx, IIS, and other web servers.
Disadvantages of CGI Programming
Performance Issues – A new process is created for each request, consuming CPU and memory.
Scalability Problems – Poor handling of high traffic due to excessive process creation.
Security Risks – If not properly configured, it can expose system vulnerabilities.
Outdated Technology – Has been replaced by faster alternatives like Servlets, JSP, PHP, Node.js, and Django.

Servlet Programming: Introduction, Advantages, and Disadvantages

Q20. Introduction to servlets and how they work.
Ans:
What is a Servlet?
A Servlet is a Java program that runs on a Java-enabled web server (e.g., Tomcat, GlassFish) and processes HTTP requests to generate dynamic web content. It is a server-side component of Java EE, designed to handle web-based interactions such as form submissions, database processing, and user authentication.
How Servlets Work?
When a client (browser) sends an HTTP request, the servlet processes it and generates a response (usually in HTML format).
Servlet Processing Flow:
Client Sends Request → A user accesses a web page or submits a form.
Web Server Receives Request → The web server forwards the request to the Servlet Container.
Servlet Container Executes Servlet → The servlet processes the request and interacts with databases or other resources if needed.
Servlet Generates Response → The servlet creates a response (HTML, JSON, XML, etc.).
Response Sent to Client → The web browser displays the result.


Q21. Advantages and disadvantages compared to other web technologies. 
Ans:
Advantages:
- Platform Independence: Java web technologies run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making them platform-independent. You can deploy your applications on any system with JVM support.
- Robust Frameworks: Java provides excellent frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and Struts that enhance development efficiency and scalability.
- Strong Security: Java has built-in security features (like secure class loading and bytecode verification) and robust libraries for encryption and authentication.
- Versatility: Suitable for everything from simple web applications to large-scale enterprise solutions, offering flexibility in architecture.
- Rich Ecosystem: Java has a mature ecosystem with extensive libraries and tools for web development.
- Standardized APIs: Java web technologies often adhere to industry standards, ensuring compatibility across servers and platforms.

Disadvantages:
- Steep Learning Curve: Java technologies like Servlets and JSP may be challenging for beginners compared to more lightweight options like PHP or Python frameworks.
- Verbose Code: Java tends to be more verbose, requiring more boilerplate code than languages like Python.
- Higher Resource Consumption: JVM-based applications can consume more system resources compared to technologies like Node.js or Ruby on Rails.
- Slower Development Speed: The rigorous setup process and detailed coding can make development slower compared to rapid development frameworks like Django or Flask.
- Complex Configuration: Frameworks like Spring can have complex configurations, requiring significant expertise.

Q23. Types of servlets: Generic and HTTP servlets
Ans:
1️. GenericServlet (Protocol-Independent Servlet)
- It is an abstract class that extends javax.servlet.Servlet.
- It is not tied to HTTP and can handle any type of request (e.g., FTP, SMTP).
- It provides basic lifecycle methods like init(), service(), and destroy().
- Developers must override the service() method to process requests.

2️. HttpServlet (HTTP-Specific Servlet)
- Extends GenericServlet but is specifically designed for handling HTTP requests.
- Provides built-in methods for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (doGet(), doPost(), etc.).
- Automatically handles session management, security, and HTTP headers.
- Developers do not override service() but instead use doGet() or doPost().

Q24.Detailed comparison between HttpServlet and GenericServlet.
Ans:
Feature	            GenericServlet	                            HttpServlet
Extends	            javax.servlet.GenericServlet	            javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet
Implements	        Servlet, ServletConfig	                    Servlet, ServletConfig
Protocol	        Can handle any protocol (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.)	    Designed specifically for HTTP
Request Handling	Must override service()	                    Must override doGet(), doPost(), etc.
Session Management	❌ No built-in session management	      Supports sessions & cookies
Security Features	❌ No built-in security	                  Supports authentication & HTTPS
Default Behavior	Must manually handle request processing	    Default service() method routes to doGet() and doPost()
Use Case	        Rare, used for generic protocols	        Commonly used in web applications

Q25. Explanation of the servlet life cycle: init(), service(), and destroy() methods.
Ans:
Servlet Life Cycle Phases:
Loading and Instantiation → Servlet is loaded and instantiated by the container.
Initialization (init()) → Called once when the servlet is created.
Request Handling (service()) → Called every time a request is received.
Destruction (destroy()) → Called once before the servlet is removed from memory.

init() Method (Initialization Phase)
Called once when the servlet is first loaded into memory.
Used to perform one-time setup (e.g., database connections, configuration loading).
It runs before handling any client request.

service() Method (Request Handling Phase)
Called every time the servlet receives a request.
Determines the request type (GET, POST, etc.) and calls the appropriate method (doGet(), doPost()).
GenericServlet requires overriding service(), while HttpServlet automatically calls doGet() or doPost()

destroy() Method (Cleanup Phase)
Called once when the servlet is about to be removed from memory.
Used to release resources (e.g., closing database connections, clearing cache).
Ensures proper cleanup before shutting down the servlet.

Q26. How to create servlets and configure them using web.xml
Ans:
Using web.xml (Deployment Descriptor) – Traditional approach for manual configuration.
web.xml Configuration Example:
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" version="3.0">

<!-- Servlet Declaration -->
<servlet>
<servlet-name>MyServlet</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>com.example.MyServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>

<!-- Servlet URL Mapping -->
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>MyServlet</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/hello</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

</web-app>

🔹 Explanation
<servlet> → Declares the servlet.
<servlet-name> → Assigns a name to the servlet.
<servlet-class> → Specifies the fully qualified class name.
<servlet-mapping> → Maps the servlet to a URL.
<url-pattern> → Defines the URL endpoint (e.g., /hello).
Now, the servlet can be accessed using: http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/hello

Q27. Explanation of logical URLs and their use in servlets.
Ans:
Logical URLs are meaningful, human-readable URLs that are designed to represent resources or actions in a web application clearly and intuitively. They improve usability, readability, and search engine optimization (SEO) while helping users and developers easily understand the purpose of the URL.

Use of Logical URLs in Servlets:
- Resource Identification: Servlets use logical URLs to map user requests to specific resources or actions, making it easier for clients to interact with the server.
- Request Handling: Logical URLs are mapped to servlet classes using configuration files like  or annotations like . This mapping allows servlets to process requests associated with specific URLs.
- Parameter Passing: Logical URLs can include query strings or path variables to pass parameters to servlets. 
- User-Friendly Navigation: Logical URLs make web applications easier to navigate for end-users.
- Bookmarking and Sharing: Logical URLs simplify bookmarking and sharing links because they are clean and meaningful.
- SEO Optimization: Search engines prioritize logical URLs since they are keyword-rich and improve the visibility of web pages.

Q28. Overview of ServletConfig and its methods.
Ans:
ServletConfig is an interface in the javax.servlet package that provides configuration information for a single servlet. It is used to pass initialization parameters to a servlet and is specific to that servlet instance.
Each servlet gets its own ServletConfig object provided by the servlet container when the servlet is initialized.

Key Methods of ServletConfig
- String getInitParameter(String name) : Returns the value of a specified initialization parameter for the servlet. Returns null if the parameter does not exist.
- Enumeration<String> getInitParameterNames() : Returns an Enumeration of all the initialization parameter names for the servlet.
- ServletContext getServletContext() : Returns the ServletContext object, which allows servlets to interact with the web application's environment.
- String getServletName()	: Returns the name of the servlet as defined in the deployment descriptor (web.xml).

RequestDispatcher Interface: Forward and Include Methods

Q29. Explanation of RequestDispatcher and the forward() and include() methods.      
Ans:
RequestDispatcher is an interface in javax.servlet that allows one servlet to forward a request to another resource (another servlet, JSP, or static file) or include the response of another resource in the current response.
It is primarily used for server-side request handling and does not involve client-side redirection.

- You can obtain a RequestDispatcher object in two ways:
Using ServletRequest:
RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("targetResource");
Using ServletContext (for resources outside the current servlet's context)
RequestDispatcher rd = getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/targetResource");

forward() Method
- Syntax: void forward(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)
- Forwards the request to another resource without sending a response to the client first. The original request and response objects are passed to the new resource.
- Transfers control to another resource on the server side.
- The original servlet stops processing after forwarding.
- The URL in the browser remains unchanged.

include() Method
- Syntax: void include(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)
- Includes the output of another resource within the response of the current servlet. The execution of the current servlet continues after the included resource completes.
- Executes another resource without stopping execution of the calling servlet.
- The output of the included resource is appended to the response of the calling servlet.
- The original servlet continues execution after including the resource.

Q30. Introduction to ServletContext and its scope.
Ans:    
ServletContext is an interface in javax.servlet that provides a way for servlets to communicate with the web application as a whole. It represents the entire application running on the server and is shared among all servlets in the same web application.

Key Features of ServletContext
- It is created when the web application is deployed and exists until the application is stopped.
- It is shared across all servlets in the application.
- It allows servlets to access global parameters, resources, and logging functionalities.
- It is used to store shared attributes that multiple servlets can access.

Scope of ServletContext
- The scope of ServletContext is application-wide, meaning:
- It is accessible from any servlet or JSP within the same web application.
- It remains available until the web application is stopped or redeployed.
- It is useful for storing global application-level data that needs to be shared among multiple components.

Obtaining ServletContext
- You can get the ServletContext object in two ways:
From ServletConfig (specific to the servlet)
- ServletContext context = getServletConfig().getServletContext();
Directly from HttpServlet
- ServletContext context = getServletContext();

Q31. How to use web application listeners for lifecycle events
Ans:
Web application listeners are special Java classes that listen for lifecycle events in a web application. They are used to perform specific actions when certain events occur, such as application startup, session creation, or request processing.
Listeners implement event-driven programming in servlets and are part of the javax.servlet package.
Types of Web Application Listeners

Servlet API provides several listener interfaces that monitor different types of events:
Listener Interface	                Monitors Events Related To
ServletContextListener	            Application (context) lifecycle (creation & destruction)
ServletContextAttributeListener	    Attribute changes in ServletContext
HttpSessionListener	                Session lifecycle (creation & destruction)
HttpSessionAttributeListener	    Attribute changes in HttpSession
ServletRequestListener	            Request lifecycle (creation & destruction)
ServletRequestAttributeListener	    Attribute changes in ServletRequest

Java Filters: Introduction and Filter Life Cycle

Q32.What are filters in Java and when are they needed?
Ans:
Filters in Java intercept requests and responses to modify, process, or inspect them before they reach a servlet or after they leave a servlet. They act as a middleware component in the request-response lifecycle.

Filters are not servlets, but they work alongside servlets to handle common functionalities such as logging, authentication, compression, and response modification.

Filters are used when we need to apply logic before or after a request reaches a servlet. Some common use cases include:
- Authentication & Authorization – Checking user credentials before processing requests.
- Logging & Auditing – Tracking user activities, request parameters, and responses.
- Compression – Compressing responses to improve performance.
- Input Validation – Sanitizing user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Modifying Requests or Responses – Changing headers, content, or encoding before sending data to the client.

Q33. Filter lifecycle and how to configure them in web.xml.
Ans:
Filter Lifecycle
A filter goes through the following stages:
- Initialization (init()) – Called once when the filter is created.
- Filtering (doFilter()) – Called for every request that matches the filter’s URL pattern.
- Destruction (destroy()) – Called once when the filter is removed from service.

Configuring Filters in web.xml (Alternative to @WebFilter)
- Instead of using annotations, filters can be configured in web.xml.
<filter>
<filter-name>LoggingFilter</filter-name>
<filter-class>com.example.LoggingFilter</filter-class>
</filter>

<filter-mapping>
<filter-name>LoggingFilter</filter-name>
<url-pattern></url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>

Q34. Introduction to JSP and its key components: JSTL, custom tags, scriplets, and implicit objects.
Ans:
JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a server-side technology used to create dynamic web pages. It allows embedding Java code in HTML using special tags. JSP is built on top of Servlets and is easier to use for view (UI) development.
Key Components of JSP:

1. JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL):
JSTL is a set of predefined tags that simplify JSP development. It replaces the need for Java code inside JSP.
Main JSTL Libraries:
JSTL Library	            Purpose	                            Example
Core (c namespace)	        Control flow, variable manipulation	<c:if>, <c:forEach>
Formatting (fmt namespace)	Number, date, currency formatting	<fmt:formatNumber>
SQL (sql namespace)	        Database operations	                <sql:query>
XML (x namespace)	        XML processing	                    <x:parse>
Functions (fn namespace)	String operations	                ${fn:length(myList)}

2. Custom Tags in JSP
Custom tags allow developers to create reusable components like standard HTML tags.
- Steps to Create a Custom Tag:
1. Create a Java class (Tag Handler)
2. Define the Tag in tld file (Tag Library Descriptor)
3. Use the Custom Tag in JSP

3. Scriptlets (<% ... %>)
Scriptlets allow embedding Java code inside JSP, but they are not recommended due to poor readability.  
<% 
int num = 10; 
out.println("Number: " + num);
%>

4. Implicit Objects
JSP provides predefined objects that developers can use directly.
Implicit Object	        Description
request	                HTTP request object (HttpServletRequest)
response	            HTTP response object (HttpServletResponse)
session	                User session (HttpSession)
application	            ServletContext for the whole web app
out	                    Writes output to the response
config	                ServletConfig object
pageContext	            Provides access to all JSP scopes
page	                Represents the JSP itself
exception	            Used in JSP error pages

Q35. Overview of session management techniques: cookies, hidden form fields, URL rewriting,
and sessions.
Ans:
Session management is essential for maintaining user state across multiple requests in web applications. The four main techniques used for session management are cookies, hidden form fields, URL rewriting, and sessions.

1. Cookies
A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client’s browser. It helps maintain state information between client and server.
How it works:
The server sends a Set-Cookie header in the HTTP response.
The browser stores the cookie and includes it in subsequent requests.

2. Hidden Form Fields
Hidden form fields store session-related data within HTML forms.
How it works:
The server embeds hidden fields in forms.
When the form is submitted, the hidden data is sent back to the server.

3. URL Rewriting
Session data is appended to the URL as query parameters.
How it works:
The server includes session data in the URL (e.g., example.com/home.jsp?sessionId=12345).
On each request, the server extracts the session information from the URL.

4. Sessions
A session stores user-specific data on the server instead of the client.
How it works:
The server creates a unique session ID and stores session data.
The session ID is shared with the client (via cookies, URL rewriting, or hidden fields).
The server retrieves the session data using the session ID.

Q36. How to track user sessions in web applications.
Ans:
User session tracking is essential in web applications to maintain user-specific data across multiple requests. Below are common techniques used to track sessions:
1. Using HTTP Sessions (Server-Side Sessions)
2. Using Cookies
3. Using URL Rewriting
4. Using Hidden Form Fields
5. Using Token-Based Authentication (JWT)
